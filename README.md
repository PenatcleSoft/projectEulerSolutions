# Project Euler Solutions

Please look away unless you don't care about spoiling solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)

## Testing solutions

Requires the Glashow Haskell Compiler (GHC) and cabal for dependencies. Available from most package managers or from source ([GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/), [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)).

Run the following in the project directory to load the module into an interactive shell:

```
cabal configure
ghci euler.hs
```

Inspect the code and run problem functions by name.
